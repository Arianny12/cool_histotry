        <h1>How it was created</h1>
        <p>Apple Computers, Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who brought to the new company a vision of changing the way people viewed computers. Jobs and Wozniak wanted to make computers small enough for people to have them in their homes or offices.</p>
        <p>Apple’s logo is one of the most recognizable in the world. However, it didn’t start out this way. The original Apple logo was designed by Apple co-founder Ronald Wayne and featured Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree with a quote by the English poet William Wordsworth, “Newton…a mind forever voyaging through strange seas of thought alone.”</p>
