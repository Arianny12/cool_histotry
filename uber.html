        <h1>How it was created</h1>
        <p>Uber’s story began in Paris in 2008. Two friends, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, were attending LeWeb, an annual tech conference The Economist. In 2007, both men sold startups they co-founded for large sums. Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai Technologies for $19 million while Camp sold StumbleUpon to eBay (EBAY) for $75 million.</p>
        <p>The concept for Uber was born one winter night during the conference when the pair was unable to get a cab. Uber was founded on a single idea: "What if you could request a ride from your phone?" Initially, the idea was for a timeshare limo service that could be ordered via an app. After the conference, the entrepreneurs went their separate ways. However, when Camp returned to San Francisco, he continued to be fixated on the idea and bought the domain name <a href="https://www.uber.com/">UberCab.com</a>.</p>
