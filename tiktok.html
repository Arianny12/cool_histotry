        <h1>How it was created</h1>
        <p>TikTok started as Douyin in 2016, owned by Chinese tech company Bytedance. It soon became popular across China. Founder Zhang Yiming had always wanted to expand Douyin overseas, so TikTok was launched for international markets in September 2017. It really took off worldwide in 2018 after merging with another Chinese social app, Musical.ly. The video-and-music combo proved popular and took the world by storm, especially during COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>
