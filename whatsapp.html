        <h1>How it was created</h1>
          <p>WhatsApp was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum as an alternative to pricey SMS services. The app allows users to upload their contact book and message anyone who has the app installed, at no cost. It is available for iPhones, Androids, and desktops. If it's free-to-use, how does WhatsApp make money?</p>
          <p><a href="https://about.meta.com/immersive-learning/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo--C1KTv-wIViorICh1SVgH6EAAYASAAEgKFyvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Meta</a>, formerly Facebook, purchased WhatsApp in February 2014 for $19 billion and according to the 2014 Facebook Form, during the nine months preceding Sept 30, 2014, WhatsApp generated revenue of $1.29 million.</p>
          <p>Governments and counter-terrorism agencies wanted the companies behind these apps to share the encryption key to gain access to messages sent and received by the terrorists. The companies, however, refused to oblige. This led to WhatsApp's adoption of end-to-end encryption, which prevents anyone, including WhatsApp, except the sender and receiver from gaining access to the data shared on the app.</p>
